Currencystack is partnering with RapidAPI to provide developers with reliable currency exchange rates for 154 world currencies for any programming environment
. RapidAPI lets developers find and connect to APIs and manage multiple API connections in one place.

The integration comes with a Freemium account option, which guarantees you 2000 API calls every month. Once you use them, you can continue to operate your account on a pay-as-you-go basis.

In offering our APIs through RapidAPI, we make it easy for developers in the community to find real-time mid-market exchange rates provided in JSON format and work for any programming environment
. The mid-market rate is the midpoint between demand and supply, that's why it changes all the time. The mid-market rate is the rate you will find on independent sources such as Google and XE. 

Currency data delivered by currencystack.io is sourced from top-level financial data providers, various commercial sources & banks
. 

Here are a few perks of using CurrencyStack through Rapid API:

* Through RapidAPI, you can discover useful APIs and connect them faster
* You get to manage all of them from one single platform
* The billing for all the APIs you use are all organized in one place
* You receive great customer support from an excellent team of developers
